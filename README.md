# PyreProtecc
does not include dogs

--
This DLL aims to patch **most** crashes and malicious actions from cheaters in Dark Souls III.
This is not meant to compete with the **PvP Watchdog** for Dark Souls III, please use Watchdog instead if you want protections only, the creators of that tool have put in a lot of hard work and we don't want to take away from that.
