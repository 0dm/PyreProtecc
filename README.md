# PyreProtecc
`does not include dogs`
# Info
This tool aims to prevent most cheats and malicious actions from cheaters in Dark Souls III such as:
- Forced items in inventory
- Forced Animations
- Crashes from Bullets
- "CrashBow" / "Slayer Crossbow"
- Malicious effects such as curse and freeze
- A wide array of networking exploits. 

If you are to encounter a **cheater**, this tool will not only stop them from using cheats on you but it will also log their actual Steam-ID in Hex and Url-form for easy posting, It will severe the connection between you and the cheater to avoid any further exploits being attempted. This DLL also has an error reporting service that logs crash info to the file so that you can contact me and I will work hard to make this tool better. It will also log every person you encounter in sessions with time-stamps.

_This is not meant to compete with the **PvP Watchdog for Dark Souls III**, please use Watchdog instead if you want protections only, the creators of that tool have put in a lot of hard work and we don't want to take away from that._

# Will I get banned?
**You will not be banned for using this tool as portions of the anti-cheat have been modified to allow this DLL to run undetected.** 

# Installation:
Download this repo as a zip and extract the contents to your game's directory so that the DLL is in the same folder as DarkSoulsIII.exe

# The DLL doesn't stop `x`, `y`, or `z`, help!
If you find that the DLL needs improvement somewhere, please open up an issue!
