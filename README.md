# PyreProtecc
# Info
This tool aims to prevent most cheats and malicious actions from cheaters in Dark Souls III such as:
- Forced items in inventory
- Forced Animations
- Crashes from Bullets
- "CrashBow" / "Slayer Crossbow"
- Malicious effects such as curse and freeze
- Players with modified stats
- A wide array of networking exploits

If you are to encounter a **cheater**, this tool will not only stop them from using cheats on you but it will also log their actual Steam-ID in Hex and Url-form for easy posting, It will severe the connection between you and the cheater to avoid any further exploits being attempted. This DLL also has an error reporting service that logs crash info to the file so that you can contact me and I will work hard to make this tool better. It will also log every person you encounter in sessions with time-stamps.

_This is not meant to compete with the **PvP Watchdog for Dark Souls III**, please use Watchdog instead if you want protections only, the creators of that tool have put in a lot of hard work and we don't want to take away from that._

# Will I get banned?
**You will not be banned for using this tool as portions of the anti-cheat have been modified to allow this DLL to run undetected.** 

# Other Settings
This tool also comes packed with my very own VFX- mod. This can be toggled on along with the hotkeys in PyresNightmareOptions.txt. I aimed to make the game more dark and gloomy much like Bloodborne. I felt the game was very washed out in some areas and wanted to change it!

# Installation:
Run the installer and set the path to your game's directory **OR** put all files except for the .exe in your game's install directory. ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game

# **Uninstall:** 
Simply rename D3DCompiler_43.dll to something else or remove it entirely.

# Other information
PyreProtecc currently makes the game run in borderless window mode, this will be configurable in a future release. Also, Dark Souls III's main menu will display "The Fire Fades Edition" under the logo, this is just a visual element of the mod to let you know it is enabled and will not grant any DLC related content. 

# The DLL doesn't stop `x`, `y`, or `z`, help!
If you find that the DLL needs improvement somewhere, please open up an issue!
